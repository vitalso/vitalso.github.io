              <p class="fs-6 mb-3">The Republic of Korea is a country with a high degree of security. The greatest difficulties for the foreign visitor (or resident) reside in the relatively poor command of English by the general population, namely employees in commercial establishments (supermarkets, shopping centers, stores), or in services. However, the authorities have been making efforts to facilitate communication and contact with foreigners in the country, through the creation of specific services or units for this purpose.</p>
              <p class="fs-6 mb-3">There are also - obviously - cultural differences that may eventually condition a better understanding of local attitudes, but they should not be dramatized. In general, the population has empathy for the visitor or resident abroad, and it is easy to find elements ready to help overcome any communication difficulties.</p>
              <p class="fs-6 mb-3">The consumption or trafficking of drugs or narcotics is penalized with heavy penalties, so all possible precautions in this matter are strongly recommended.</p>
              <p class="mb-0 fs-16"><strong>Weather</strong></p>
              <p class="fs-6 mb-3">In Korea there are four distinct seasons. Spring and Autumn are short seasons. Summer is hot and humid. July is the month of rains. Winter is cold and dry, accompanied by snowfalls. The temperature varies with the regions of the country. In summer it can reach 33º centigrade and in winter more than minus 10º.</p>
              <p class="mb-0 fs-16"><strong>Language</strong></p>
              <p class="fs-6 mb-3">The official language is Korean. English, Japanese and Chinese are the most widely spoken foreign languages.</p>
              <p class="mb-0 fs-16"><strong>Local currency / banking system</strong></p>
              <p class="fs-6 mb-3">The local currency is won (KRW). The exchange rate can be consulted on the Banco de Portugal portal. You should check with your bank and make sure the electronic cards are valid at local ATMs. Major credit cards are accepted in most shops and restaurants in the main urban centres.</p>
