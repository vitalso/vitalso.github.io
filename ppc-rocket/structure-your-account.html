                                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                                    <p>Google Ads is a paid advertising platform that allows businesses to place ads on Google and its partner websites. When done correctly, Google Ads can be an extremely effective way to reach new customers and grow your business. However, it is tricky to get right without lots of time, support and experience. </p>
                                    <p>Structuring your Account correctly is a key way to get the most out of the platform by ensuring your ads are relevant to the different segments in your exact target audience and individual ads and keywords can be easily tested against each other and analysed to continually improve results. This article will give you some key advice for structuring different elements of your Account, from Campaigns and Ad Groups to individual Keywords and Ads.</p>
                                </div>


                                <div id="chapter-2">
                                    <h2>Account structure</h2>
                                    <p>Most businesses will only require one Google Ads Account, but large or complicated enterprises may choose to start separate Accounts for different locations, ad networks, campaign types, teams and areas of business. For each Account, you will need to have a clear idea of what to focus on and which Google Ad Networks you want to appear on.</p>
                                    <h4>Naming Conventions</h4>
                                    <p>A good place to start is to create a plan for which relevant and descriptive Account, Campaign, and Ad Group names to use. This way you can keep things clear, avoid missing any vital areas you want to promote and allow your Ads to be as specific as possible, helping you to achieve the best results. The larger your campaigns and the more networks you run ads on the more important structure is, however thinking carefully about structure and naming conventions even when starting a small campaign is always a good idea as you never know how much your advertising will need to be scaled in the future.</p>
                                    <h4>Use Your Website</h4>
                                    <p>One of the first things to consider when planning what to advertise is that, if you offer multiple services or products, it is unwise to try to promote everything which means a lot of work and should only be attempted by those with plenty of Google Ads experience. Instead, focus on one or two key offerings, a good place to start could be your most popular product or service, a product or service you are particularly keen to sell, or a loss leader product or service that can be particularly attractive to customers.</p>
                                    <h4>Google Ads Networks</h4>
                                    <p>There are four main types of networks on Google Ads: search, display, video, and shopping. You will need to have decided which of these you wish to operate in before you set up your Account. </p>
                                    <ul class="blog-list-features-compact mb-5 p-0">
                                        <li>Search ads are the most common type of Google Ad and appear as text when people search for keywords that are relevant to your business. </li>
                                        <li>Display ads appear on websites that are part of the Google Display Network and can be used to target specific demographics or interests.</li>
                                        <li>Video ads appear on YouTube and can be a great way to reach a wide audience.</li>
                                        <li>Shopping ads appear on Google Shopping and allow customers to compare products and prices before they make a purchase.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>


                                <div id="chapter-3">
                                    <h2>Campaign structure</h2>
                                    <p>In many cases, businesses choose to split up their campaigns in a similar way to the product or service categories on their website which helps keep things simple and organized. However, the Campaign structure that will work best for you will depend on how many different products and services you are offering. Fortunately, you can have up to 10,000 Campaigns per Account which makes it easy to keep stay organized unless you have an extremely large range of products or services.</p>
                                    <h4>Small range campaign structures</h4>
                                    <p>For those who have a relatively small range of products or services, it can often be a good idea to create separate Campaigns for each of your offerings. This will help you to better target your ads and ensure your budget is being spent most effectively. </p>
                                    <h4>Large range campaign structures</h4>
                                    <p>Larger businesses with a wider variety of products and services may find it useful to use the subcategories used on their website. This is a great way to keep things highly relevant, but keep in mind that managing several campaigns can make things confusing, especially when working alone or in a small or inexperienced team. </p>
                                    <h4>Broader campaign structures</h4>
                                    <p>Alternatively, they could choose to set up broader campaigns based, for example, on each goal e.g. having one for sales and one for web traffic can make things simpler. Another broader structuring strategy for those businesses with a large range of offerings could be to organize Campaigns by match type e.g. one for keywords that are an exact match, and another for broarder matched keywords. This way you can cast a wider net with the broad match campaigns, while still keeping the exact match campaign focused on only the most relevant keywords.</p>
                                </div>


                                <div id="chapter-4">
                                    <h2>Ad Group structure</h2>
                                    <p>Just like with Campaigns exactly how you structure your Ad Groups will depend on how wide a range of products and services you offer. Fortunately, you can have up to 20,000 Ad Groups per Campaign which is more than sufficient for most small to medium-sized businesses.</p>
                                    <p>Many businesses will use their websites to inform these decisions. Use the product or service subcategories as the focus for you Ad Group to stay organised and avoid missing any key areas you need to promote, especially for those with a smaller range of services or products. This will also help you to better target your ads and ensure that they are being seen by the right people. For example, if you are a clothing store, you may have a single Ad Group for men’s shorts. </p>
                                    <p>Another option is to think about the different individual ads you want to run, then group them by keyword themes and use them as the basis of your different Ad Groups. This is a useful technique when you are only targeting a few services or products with a few key messages you want to put across in your ads. Fortunately, Google Ads allows 50 active text and non-image/gallery ads per ad group and up to 300 image/gallery ads per Ad Group in total, including inactive ads.</p>
                                    <p>When promoting a wide range of products or services it is best to get as specific as possible while avoiding overlap between different Ad Groups. So going back to that example of the men’s clothing store, rather than simply having the Ad Group for men’s shorts you could choose to get more specific and have four Ad Groups for men’s casual shorts, men’s swim shorts, men’s sports shorts (or even further into different style - ‘men’s cargo shorts’ for example. Of course, the more specific you go the more time-consuming and difficult your ad management becomes, however, your ads will also be more relevant to your target audience and likely to achieve better results. Note: with the PPC Rocket Keyword Grouper you can easily create Ad Groups even if you want to group several hundred of keywords.</p>
                                    <p><b>Please Note:</b> You can also make use of negative keywords within each Ad Group. This will help to filter out any unwanted clicks and ensure that your ads are only being seen by people who are the most relevant and interested in the product or service you are offering in the specific Ad Group. Using the <b>PPC Rocket NGram Tool</b> you can easily identify and add negative keywords.</p>
                                    <h4>Landing pages</h4>
                                    <p>One of the most important aspects of creating an effective campaign is your website's landing pages, those sales-orientated webpages that your ads link to. Your landing pages should be designed to convert visitors into customers or leads, but they also affect the Quality Score. They should be relevant to the keywords you're targeting and contain a strong call to action. They need to relate to your goal and ideally, you would have a specific landing page for every Ad Group. </p>
                                    <p>Keep your target keywords in mind and include them in the page copy. You should also make sure your page includes all the important information people will need to take action. If you're not sure how to create an effective landing page, there are plenty of resources available online. Google even offers a free tool called Google Optimize, which can help you create and test different versions of your landing pages. </p>
                                    <p>By taking the time to create effective landing pages, you'll be able to get the best results from Google Ads. It is for this reason that many businesses may choose to make decisions on the focus and structure of Ad Groups with their strongest landing landing pages in mind.</p>

                                <div id="chapter-5">
                                    <h2>Keyword structure</h2>
                                    <p>One of the most important aspects of running a successful Google Ads campaign is choosing the right keywords and structuring them. A solid keyword structure will help you choose the right keywords and attract the right customers. In addition, they will also help you improve your Quality Score, which will mean you can save money on your campaigns.</p>
                                    <p>There are a few different ways to structure your keywords, and the best depends on the business. However, there are a few general tips that can help you get started:</p>

                                    <h4 class="mt-5">Relevant and specific keywords</h4>
                                    <p>The more relevant and specific your keywords are, the more likely you are to attract the right customers. For example, if you sell women’s clothing, using the keyword “women’s clothing” is more likely to attract customers than using the keyword “clothing”.</p>

                                    <h4 class="mt-5">Long-tail keywords</h4>
                                    <p>Long-tail keywords are longer and more specific phrases than shorter, more general keywords. Although they usually have a lower search volume, they are also often far less competitive and can be more effective at attracting customers interested in your exact offering. For example, going back to our example of a women’s clothing store, a long-tail keyword such as “women’s plus size clothing” is more specific than the keyword “women’s clothing” and is more likely to attract customers who are looking for plus size clothing.</p>

                                    <h4 class="mt-5">Negative keywords</h4>
                                    <p>Negative keywords are words or phrases that you don’t want to trigger your ad. For example, if you sell women’s clothing, you might want to use negative keywords such as “men’s” or “boy’s” to make sure your ad doesn’t show up when someone searches for those terms.</p>

                                    <h4 class="mt-5">Keyword match types</h4>
                                    <p>Keyword match types help you control how closely related a search term must be to your keyword for your ad to show up. There are four main match types: </p>
                                    <ul class="blog-list-features-compact mb-5 p-0">
                                        <li>Broad match - The most general and will show your ad for any search term that includes your keyword, even if it’s not an exact match.</li>
                                        <li>Phrase match - Slightly more specific and will only show your ad for searches that include your keyword phrase in the same order as your keyword phrase.</li>
                                        <li>Exact match - The most specific and will only show your ad for searches that exactly match your keyword phrase. </li>
                                        <li>Negative match - The same as the negative keyword list, excludes certain words or phrases from triggering an individual ad.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h4 class="mt-5">Experiment and research different keyword variations</h4>
                                    <p>There are endless combinations of keywords that you can use for your campaigns. The best way to find the right combination is to experiment with different combinations and variations to see what works best for your business. </p>
                                    <p>You can also use tools like Google Keyword Planner to see data on search volume and competition for keywords and find new variations to try. Google Analytics can also be useful for seeing what keywords people are currently using to find your site which is useful for finding new additions to the negative keyword list and identifying the keywords that are already working well for you. </p>

                                    <h2>Ad structure and extensions</h2>
                                    <p>It is important to use relevant and targeted keywords throughout your ad copy. This will help to improve your click-through rate and ensure that your ads are being seen by the people who are most likely to convert. </p>
                                    <p>Every ad group should have at least 3 quality ads. That way, the system can optimize your performance, and you can check your performance data to learn what message resonates best with your audience. You should have at least one responsive search ad per ad group, maximum is three. But it also depends on the traffic you are generating for this ad group. A good advise is to pin headlines and descriptions in your responsive search ads to improve performance</p>
                                    <p>Extensions are another important aspect of ad copy and structure. These optional elements, like site links and callouts, can help you improve your ads' visibility and click-through rates and provide an additional valuable opportunity to stand out from the competition that should not be ignored.</p>
                                </div>


                                <div id="chapter-7">
                                    <h2>Common Account structures</h2>
                                    <p>We have already mentioned some of the strategies for structuring the different elements of your campaign, now we will examine some of the most popular structures and their benefits and drawbacks.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">Single Keyword Ad Groups (SKAGs)</h4>
                                    <p>The SKAG structure has been used for many years thanks to its simplicity. Here campaigns are structured with one keyword per Ad Group. This means you write highly specific ads for that specific keyword which makes it easier to maximize relevance, CTR, Quality Score, and conversion rate. However, they also make it very time-consuming for businesses with a wide range of products or services as even with smaller businesses this type of structure requires a lot of keywords and Ad Groups.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">Alpha/Beta </h4>
                                    <p>With this structure two sets of Campaigns are created with the same ads and target keywords, the only difference is the keyword match type. Usually, the Alpha campaigns will be set to exact match terms and the Beta campaigns will be set to the broad match type. This way you can still attract those most relevant customers with the Alpha campaign while using the Beta campaigns to reach a wider audience. </p>

                                    <h4 class="mt-5">Single Keyword Multi-Match Type Ad Groups</h4>
                                    <p>This works similarly to the Alpha/Beta structure but instead of splitting into two campaigns to use the multi-match, you split the Ad Groups by match type. This way your Account can be more simple to manage with fewer Campaigns to worry about. Plus more data is collected in each campaign so it is easier to optimize and use tools like smart bidding. On the other hand, you will have no keyword-level control for smart bidding and your different match types compete against themselves. Plus, adding negative keywords across all your Ad Groups can be a hassle. </p>
                                    <p>We have already mentioned that you can organize Ad Groups by the specific messaging you want to include in your ads. If you have a few main key messages you want to use in your profiles it is a good idea to create several different ad headlines or descriptions related to each of the messages so you can learn about which specific message and wording is most effective.</p>
                                    <p>Although these are three of the main types of Google Ads structure there are plenty of more options to choose from as well as bespoke structures and combinations of different types. For example, modern Google Ads specialists now often use a combination of SKAG and Alpha/Beta which reportedly work well together and can give you the best of both structures</p>

                                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                    <p>When it comes to Google Ads, structure is key. By being thoughtful and strategic about how you organize your account, you can set yourself up for success and ensure that your campaigns are effective and efficient. This is especially important as you scale your campaigns and grow your business as, by taking the time to create a well-organized Google Ads account, you can save yourself a lot of time and headaches down the road. </p>
                                    <p>Without the right experience, knowledge and a considerable amount of time to dedicate to planning your Account structure, it can seem like an impossible task. This is why so many businesses hire extra support when starting with Google Ads, or completely outsource the setup/management. Get in touch with PPC Rocket to see how our expert teams and tools can help streamline the planning, structuring and setup of Google Ads for your business. </p>
