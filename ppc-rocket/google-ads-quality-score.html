                                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                                    <p>With so much competition online, marketers need to do everything they can to help their business get noticed. The wide range of marketing and advertising channels available online, can make it difficult to fully understand which are the most effective for your specific brand, offering, target audience and messaging.</p>
                                    <p>Google Ads is seen by some as a complicated system that is ineffective and expensive. However, any Google Ads expert will tell you that, when done correctly, PPC advertising on Google can be transformative.</p>
                                    <p>To ensure effective campaigns and a decent ROI, you need to consider working on your Quality Score, Google’s ranking system for understanding the effectiveness of your Google Ads. Although Google closely guards the specifics of what makes up Quality Score, experts have undergone considerable testing and research to ensure they know as much as possible about this mysterious metric.</p>
                                    <p>In this article, we will talk through what experts believe makes up Quality Score, why it is so important to online marketers and advertisers, and share some tools and actionable tips to help you improve your Google Ads Quality Score.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div id="chapter-2">
                                    <h2>What is the Google Ads Quality Score and why is it important?</h2>
                                    <p>The Quality Score is a metric included for analytics on Google Ads. It is used to help Google determine which user’s ads should appear, and where, when a relevant term is searched in Google.</p>
                                    <p><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/140351?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google defines Quality Score</a> as: ‘An estimate of the quality of your ads, keywords, and landing pages.’</p>
                                    <p>The Quality Score is designed to help Google’s users find the most useful, relevant and high-quality information on the web, in relation to the term they search. It does this by assigning the keywords you have set as your bidding targets, a Quality Score. Google will then give preference and serve ads for any searched keywords that, among other factors, have a higher Quality Score.</p>
                                    <p>The most obvious preference Google gives is lowering the bid price for those high Quality Score keywords. In this way Google uses the Quality Score to help even the playing field by allowing businesses with smaller budgets to compete with those with larger budgets through quality.</p>
                                    <p>The Quality Score is used in each of the two Google Ads networks:</p>
                                    <ul class="blog-list-features mb-5 p-0">
                                        <li><strong>The Search Network</strong> covers ‘pull’ ads served on Google’s channels: Google Search, Shopping, Google Maps and Google Groups as well as Google’s other partnered search sites. Here you can publish Text ads, Dynamic Search Ads, responsive search ads, shopping ads and call-only ads. The partnered search sites can host image and video ads too.</li>
                                        <li><strong>The Display Network</strong> covers ‘push’ ads that will appear across various websites based on pre-set targeting parameters. They can appear on more than 2 million sites, including YouTube, Blogger and Gmail, and reach over 90% of online users. However, unlike the Search Network, you cannot see Quality Score in the Display Network as it exists behind the scenes as a visible column that you can refer to.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>

                                <div id="chapter-3">
                                    <h2>What are the benefits of a good Quality Score?</h2>
                                    <p>We have already touched on what makes the Quality Score so important. But the benefits of developing a strong Quality Score will affect many aspects of your campaigns. Here are the key benefits a good Quality Score can bring:</p>
                                    <ul class="blog-list-features mb-5 p-0">
                                        <li><strong>Lower Costs:</strong> Due to the aforementioned preferences Google has for those keywords it calculates as high quality, advertisers with high Quality Score keywords can be rewarded with cheaper bidding. This means that you may not have to spend as much money to outbid your competition, especially if you have a higher Quality Score than your competitors. Plus, with lower cost per bid, you will likely mean your cost per conversion will decrease. </li>
                                        <li><strong>Better Ad Visibility:</strong> Google will assign a better rank to high quality ads. This means your ads will appear higher up on the page and will therefore be more visible. This will result in increased impressions, which should mean increased engagement and clicks.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Increased Conversions:</strong> As we will explain in detail later, two of the factors that determine Quality Score relate to your landing page and ad relevance. This means that if you have a good Quality Score, your landing pages are likely to be high-quality and relevant. This should result in an increased conversion rate.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>

                                <div id="chapter-4">
                                    <h2>Is the Quality Score still relevant in 2022?</h2>
                                    <p>The short answer is yes. With so many changes to Google algorithms it is possible that the Quality Score could lose some of its importance. However, experts agree that it is still a vital part of developing a successful Google Ads campaign.</p>
                                    <p>PPC agencies and Google Ads specialists frequently cite the following three reasons as to why Quality Score is still so important in Google Ads:</p>
                                    <ul class="blog-list-features mb-5 p-0 list-style-decimal">
                                        <li>It is still key to understanding how to improve your Google Ads campaign(s). You can easily see what keywords and Ad Groups are performing poorly in your campaigns and see what areas you should focus on optimizing. It also indicates how Google considers your Ad Quality and Ad Relevance.</li>
                                        <li>It still helps you save money by decreasing the cost per bid.</li>
                                        <li>Although leveraging automation and machine learning to improve campaigns is commonplace in PPC advertising; this approach can negatively impact relevance. Using Quality Score you can easily track this impact.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>

                                <div id="chapter-5">
                                    <h2>What are the Quality Score Factors/Components?</h2>
                                    <p>Google has been characteristically secret about what exactly makes up their Quality Score formula. However they have revealed three key components that determine the metric:</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Factor 1: Expected Click-Through Rate (Exp. CTR)</h3>
                                    <p>This is a keyword status in Google Ads. The three statuses (above average, average, or below average) indicate the probability of any given searched keyword resulting in a click on one of your ads. Ignoring your ad position and all other variables affecting the visibility of your ads, the Exp. CTR is an estimate that takes into account how well your keyword has performed historically.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Factor 2: Ad Relevance</h3>
                                    <p>Google defines Ad Relevance as: ‘How closely your ad matches the intent behind a user's search.’</p>
                                    <p>The key to Ad Relevance is finding ways to reach your target audience. This is achieved by creating new ads with varying the advertising text, images or targeting. You can then use A/B testing to develop ads with a higher relevance score as we will explain in depth later.</p>
                                    <p>What is important for scoring higher in Ad Relevance differs depending on the advertising network:</p>
                                    <ul class="blog-list-features mb-5 p-0">
                                        <li><strong>Search Network:</strong> Where relevant ads closely match the user’s search query.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Display Network:</strong> Where an ad is most relevant if the user has visited the ad’s destination website already or engaged with the brand previously through another channel.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Factor 3: Landing Page Experience</h3>
                                    <p>The Landing Page Experience is an estimate of how relevant and useful your website's landing page will be to those who click on your ad.

                                    <h2>What are the different types of Quality Score?</h2>
                                    <p>Google does not confirm the existence of every type of Google Quality Score. However, it is generally accepted that there are more hidden levels of the score outside of the keyword-level Quality Score visible in Google Ads. These additional levels, explained below, are helpful for comparing different Ad Groups, Campaigns and Accounts in order to work out what areas you need to optimize.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Account-Level Quality Score</h3>
                                    <p>Account-level Quality Score is the result of the historical performance of all keywords and ads in an account and is not visible in Google Ads. An account with a large amount of keywords with low Quality Scores, low CTR, and a history of poor performance will be given a weaker Quality Score. This can make it more expensive to run campaigns, even when introducing new keywords in the same account.</p>
                                    <p>The length of time you have been using the Google Ads account also has a determining factor. Google can favor old accounts over new ones. Those accounts with a longer history of good performance will be especially favored and for those with a bad performance it can be a long and difficult process to improve your Account-Level Quality Score. Frustratingly, Google has also made it impossible to delete your account and start fresh.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Ad Group-Level Quality Score</h3>
                                    <p>Ad Group-Level Quality Score is only visible as the average of the keyword Quality Scores for a given Ad Group. This helps to identify which Ad Groups are performing poorly and need to be optimized.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Campaign-Level Quality Score</h3>
                                    <p>Campaign-Level Quality Score takes into account all the advertising content in your campaign. It can tell you how relevant your campaigns are to your search terms when compared to competitors who are targeting the same audiences. Although it is not visible in Google Ads, PPC Rocket offers a solution for finding the Campaign-Level Quality Score.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Brand vs. Non-Brand Quality Score</h3>
                                    <p>Another type of Quality Score made available by PPC Rocket relates to your branded and non-branded keywords. Branded are those that include the brand's name in the term, unbranded don’t. It is useful to split these up as you should expect to have a higher Quality Score and see stronger KPIs for any key terms and include your brand’s name, although they are not likely to have very high search volumes.. Plus, if you are bidding on a competitor’s branded keywords you should expect them to have a far lower Quality Score, which can throw off your other results.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Label Quality Score</h3>
                                    <p>This Quality Score, also made visible via the PPC Rocket tool,  aggregates the Quality Score for any labels you may have connected to your keywords.</p>
                                    <p>Labels are custom additions for keywords, campaigns, ad groups, and ads in Google Ads. They allow you to organize and filter them into categories. PPC Rocket aggregates a general Quality Score, for everything connected with a label, so you can decide which elements of your campaigns you want to understand together and compare all the assets relating to one label with another.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Keyword-level Quality Score</h3>
                                    <p>This Quality Score for your individual keywords is the only type of Google Quality Score plainly visible on Google Ads. This score out of ten is based on the performance of search queries that exactly match your targeted keyword. </p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">What is the Google Ads Ad Quality?</h3>
                                    <p>Ad Quality is an estimated score for the experience users receive when your ads are displayed in their searches.</p>
                                    <p>It is based on several factors, some of the most important of which are how relevant your ad text is to the searches and how likely it is that your ads will receive a click and Landing page experience. It also  covers other factors that do not contribute to your Quality Score, including:</p>
                                    <ul class="blog-list-features-compact mb-5 p-0">
                                        <li>Devices used in search</li>
                                        <li>Location of user</li>
                                        <li>Time of day</li>
                                        <li>Ad extensions</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>In a similar way to all quality scores, a high Ad Quality is likely to lead to better ad positions, lower costs and improved performance.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">The Impression Threshold</h3>
                                    <p>When you first start your campaign your Keyword-Level Quality Score will be largely based on their historic data from Google searches. However, once the keyword has achieved a significant number of impressions on your account this changes.</p>
                                    <p>This is known as The Impression Threshold and after this point the performance of your ad groups, campaign and account will start to be reflected in your Quality Score. For example, keywords with low Quality Scores can receive a boost if you have a high Account-Level Quality Score or vice versa. The bottom line is that there is little you can do to improve the Quality Score for individual keywords until they have reached The Impression Threshold.</p>
                                    <p>To increase advert impressions and reach The Impression Threshold you could consider:</p>
                                    <ul class="blog-list-features mb-5 p-0 list-style-decimal">
                                        <li>Making the targeting less niche.</li>
                                        <li>Increasing your daily budgets or boosting bids to rank in higher positions.</li>
                                        <li>Loosening restrictive match types (like phrase or exact matches) or adding broad match keywords.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>

                                    <h2>How is the Quality Score calculated?</h2>
                                    <p>We have already mentioned the three key components that make up the aforementioned Keyword-Level Quality Score: Click-Through Rate (CTR), Ad Relevance and Landing Page Experience.</p>
                                    <p>Obviously these components will be included in Quality Score calculations, but it is unclear how much weight Google gives to each of them and if this weighting changes depending on the situation.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">What is the Quality Score formula?</h3>
                                    <p>Google keeps the exact formula for Quality Score closely guarded. However, experts at <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ads-the-quality-score-formula-revealed-348063" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Search Engine Landing (SEL) analyzed 15 000+ Google Ads accounts</a> to shed light on the illusive calculation.

                                    <p>As you can see, the Quality Score is calculated by the sum of the Exp. CTR, the Ad Relevance and the Landing Page Experience plus 1.

                                    <p>This calculation has been tried and tested for over 2 years by SEL and they believe it works. If it is true, it also provides the following actionable insights:</p>

                                        <li>Improving the CTR or the Landing Page is twice as impactful as improving Ad Relevance.</li>
                                        <li>If you score Above Average in one component then there is no benefit to improving it further.</li>
                                        <li>The history or legacy of your account does not affect the Quality Score as previously believed.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>To better understand what makes up a quality score we must delve into the calculations around Ad Relevance, Exp. CTR, and Landing Page Experience.</p>

                                    <h3 class="mt-5">What are the Ad Rank and Ad Position, and how are they calculated?</h3>
                                    <p>Ad Position is the order your ad appears on the SERP in relation to the other ads. An Ad Position of 1 will mean the ad is displayed first at the top of the page. The Ad Rank is the score that determines if and where on the page your ad will be displayed.</p>
                                    <p>As with Quality Score, the exact formula Google uses to determine Ad Rank is a secret. However, the components that contribute to Ad Rank are well known and consist of:</p>
                                    <ul class="blog-list-features mb-5 p-0">
                                        <li><strong>Max Bid:</strong> The maximum an advertiser is willing to pay for a click on a given keyword.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Ad Format:</strong> Additional format features, such as ad extensions, which impact CTR e.g. call buttons, location information, links to specific parts of your website, and additional text.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Quality Score:</strong> Which, as we now know, includes Ad Relevance, Landing page experience, and Exp. CTR.</li>

                                    <p>Writing for <a href="https://www.verticalrail.com/kb/ad-rank-formula/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vertical Rail</a>, David Haefele describes what their research illuminated in terms of the weighting for each of Ad Rank’s components. He concludes that, when looking to improve Ad Rank, the most important aspects to work on are the Ad Format and Quality Score. So for those looking to minimize costs while improving Ad Position, Quality Score plays a vital role.</p>

                                    <h3 class="mt-5">What does not affect the Quality Score?</h3>
                                    <p>As we have seen, the components that make up Quality Score have been carefully chosen and weighted by Google. However, there are a few other components which are worth mentioning with, although they are closely related, do not impact on Quality Score.</p>

                                    <p>You can find the Quality Score in Google Ads for every keyword you include in your campaigns on Google Ads:</p>
                                    <ul class="blog-list-features mb-5 p-0">
                                        <li>Once logged on to your Account select Keywords in the menu on the left of the page.</li>
                                        <li>On the upper right corner of the keywords table click the columns icon represented by three vertical lines.</li>

                                    <p>Alternatively, to view historic Quality Score stats for the given reporting period you have selected, choose from the following metrics: Quality Score (hist.), Landing Page Exp. (hist.), Ad Relevance (hist.), and Exp. CTR. (hist.).</p>
                                    <p>Please note: If you see a “—” where the Quality Score is, this means that the keywords has not yet reached The Impression Threshold and received enough searches to enable Google to determine the score. </p>

                                    <h2>Is it possible to know a competitor’s Google Ads Quality Score?</h2>
                                    <p>No, Google does not offer this information. The closest you can come to understanding a competitor’s Quality Score is to <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2579754?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">use Auction Insights to compare performance</a>. This Auction Insights report allows you to compare your performance with other advertisers who are in the same auctions as you. On the Search Network you can see six metrics on the report:</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">Impression share</h4>
                                    <p>This is the number of impressions you received, divided by the estimated number of impressions you were eligible to receive. The eligibility estimate is based on Quality Score as well as targeting settings and approval statuses.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">Overlap rate</h4>
                                    <p>This is how often another advertiser’s ad received an impression at the same time your ad received one. For example, an Overlap rate of 70% will mean that 7 out of 10 times your ad was displayed so was one of your competitor’s.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">Outranking share</h4>
                                    <p>This tells you how often your ad ranked higher in the auction than a competitor's or if your ad is displayed when the competitor;s was not. For example, an Outrank share of 30% means your ad outranked a competitor’s, or that your ad showed when the competitor’s didn’t, for 3 out of every 10 eligible impressions.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">Position above rate</h4>
                                    <p>This is how often the competitor’s ad was shown in a higher position than yours when both ads are displayed at the same time. For example, a 10% Position above rate means that the competitor’s ad was displayed above yours for 10 out of every 100 times your ads were displayed together.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">Top of page rate</h4>
                                    <p>This tells you how often your ad or the ad of a competitor (depending on the row) was displayed at the top of the SERP above the organic results. For example, a Top of page rate of 30% means that for every 100 impressions your ads appeared for, 30 of them had your ads in on the spots at the top of the page.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">Absolute top of the page rate</h4>
                                    <p>This indicates how often your ad or a competitor’s ad (depending on the row) was displayed as the very first spot at the top of the SERP. For example, a 20% Absolute top of the page rate means that for every 100 impressions 20 of them had your ads displayed in the number one spot.</p>
                                    <p>So long as your campaign has enough activity, you can view these statistics for one or more keywords, Ad Groups or campaigns.</p>

                                    <h2>What is a Good Quality Score?</h2>
                                    <p>Quality Score is a rating on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being the worst and 10 the best. In general, any keyword with a Quality Score of 7-10 could be considered to have a good score. However, this range changes depending on commercial intent, level of competition and keyword type.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Intent and competition</h3>
                                    <p>For those more competitive, high-intent keywords a good Quality Score is considered anything above 3. Whereas, those low competition, low-intent keywords should aim for a score of 7 or above.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Branded and unbranded keywords</h3>
                                    <p>A good Quality Score for branded keywords is considered to be between 8 and 10. However, for those unbranded keywords you should expect a lower Quality Score, with anything from 7 and above considered good.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Competitor keywords</h3>
                                    <p>You can not expect to achieve the same level of relevance when bidding on branded competitor keywords. It is for this reason that a score of 3 and above should be considered strong when bidding on a competitor's keyword.</p>
                                    <p>Keep in mind that when a new keyword is added, as Google does not have all the data needed to complete the Quality Score formula, it will automatically be assigned a score of 6. Developing a strong Quality Score in Google Ads is an ongoing process that requires many optimizations, as we will explain in the next section.</p>

                                    <h2>17 Strategies for improving Google Ads Quality Score</h2>
                                    <p>Now we have a developed understanding of the Quality Score and why it is so important, it is time to consider the different strategies you can implement to boost your score. We have already introduced a few of the key ways to improve the factors that contribute to Quality Score but now we explore specific actionable approaches for how to improve Quality Score Google Ads.</p>
                                    <p>Although there is no saying when and how Google may adjust its Quality Score formula, and how much we think we know about it is correct, experts agree that the following 17 strategies are proven to increase the 3 factors, Expected CTR, Ad Relevance and Landing Page Experience, that make up the Google Ads Quality Score and tips of testing, optimizing and tracking progress.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Improving Expected CTR</h3>
                                    <p>CTR itself is an important element of the Quality Score as it informs the key component, Exp. CTR. If your Exp. CTR is rated Average or lower, then you should consider the following strategies for improving it.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">1. Optimize your ad copy</h4>
                                    <p>One of the most important factors that contribute to CTR is your ad copy, so getting this right can make all the difference. You could consider making the following optimizations. </p>
                                    <ul class="blog-list-features-compact mb-5 p-0">
                                        <li>Including relevant keywords.</li>
                                        <li>Match the ad copy to the intent of your keywords.</li>
                                        <li>Highlight an enticing promotion, stat or USP of your offer</li>
                                        <li>Try different calls-to-action (CTAs): Buy, Sell, Order, Browse, Find, Sign Up, Try, Get a Quote, etc.</li>
                                        <li>Be more specific in your ad copy.</li>
                                        <li>Edit your ad text to be more compelling for your target audience.</li>
                                        <li>Highlight a unique benefit or promotion in your ad copy.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Keep in mind that although an ad can have a low CTR, this does not necessarily mean it is performing badly. You can have a good conversion rate while still having a low CTR , so it is best to look for an imbalance between the two as this will tell you that either the ad or the landing page are not working well.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">2. Work on your negative keyword lists</h4>
                                    <p>The negative keyword list is a feature on Google Ads that allows you to block your ads from appearing under certain searches. For example, if you are a clothing store only selling womens’ clothes you may wish to block ‘men’s clothing’ to avoid paying for clicks from users only interested in buying men’s clothes.</p>
                                    <p>It’s an important feature and a good way to save money for sure, but how does it relate to Quality Score? You will recall the Exp. CTR component of the Quality Score Google Ads formula, this is the part that your negative keyword efforts can boost resulting in an improved Quality Score.</p>
                                    <p>Using the negative keyword list, you can ensure your ads only appear to relevant people in your target audience. This in turn will mean that your ads are likely to experience an increase in clicks, which should lead to improved CTRs and conversion rates. However, you must choose your negative keywords carefully, as adding too many may mean your ads reach fewer customers.</p>
                                    <p><strong>How to get ideas for the negative keywords </strong></p>
                                    <p>You can get ideas for your negative keyword list using the <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2472708?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">search terms report</a> in Google Ads. This report shows the actual search terms people are searching for which trigger your ad to appear. By looking out for any of the actual search terms in this report that are similar but not exactly related to your offer, you can find ideas for words and phrases that you should add as negative keywords.</p>
                                    <p>To access the search terms report, on your Google Ads account Sign in to your Google Ads account click keywords on the left-side menu. You can then see the Search terms for all keywords by clicking Search terms at the top of the page. Alternatively, you can select groups of keywords by checking the corresponding boxes next to each and then clicking the Search terms button</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">3. Pause or delete low Quality Score keywords</h4>
                                    <p>If you have tried and failed to improve a keyword’s Quality Score, there are generally believed to be two potential options: delete or pause them.</p>
                                    <p>Either option will mean they stop accumulating data and reduce their effect on your Account-level Quality Score. However, if you choose to delete the keywords, keep in mind that you may struggle to turn them back on if you change your mind later.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">4. Get creative with your messaging</h4>
                                    <p>Due to the various factors that contribute to the Google Quality Score simply copying the advert displayed in the number one spot in the SERPs will not improve Quality Score. Instead, you need to be creative and compelling when writing your ad copy and landing page.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">5. Enable and optimize Ad extensions </h4>
                                    <p>Another way you can be creative is through <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375499?hl=en#:~:text=Extensions%20expand%20your%20ad%20with,%2C%20additional%20text%2C%20and%20more." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ad extensions</a>. These are free additions that can make your Google ads more visible and can result in increased CTR, which can then boost Quality Score. They come in various formats, some of which make your ad more engaging and others provide alternative ways for the user to reach out to you.</p>
                                    <p>There are two types of extensions: automatic extensions which are added automatically by Google when it deems an ad relevant and qualified, or other extensions added manually.</p>
                                    <h5 class="mt-5">Automatic extensions</h5>
                                    <p><strong>Dynamic sitelink extensions:</strong> These help people get to the right place on your website. For example, a restaurant may have links to Hours, Menu, Delivery automatically added to their ads.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Dynamic structured snippet extensions:</strong> These include additional descriptive text, taken automatically from your website, that helps people get a better sense of the range of your business’s offer.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Automated location extensions:</strong> These help people find your business’s physical location(s) by automatically displaying your ads with addresses, directions to and information on the distance from the business’s location. They can also include contact buttons.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Affiliate location extensions:</strong> These are very similar to automated location extensions but focus on helping customers find retailers that sell your products.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Seller ratings extensions:</strong> These are your businesses star ratings and reviews that can be automatically displayed next to your ads.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Dynamic callout extensions:</strong> These help people decide whether to visit your site by automatically displaying relevant information about the products and services you have available.</p>
                                    <h5 class="mt-5">Manual extensions</h5>
                                    <p><strong>Call extensions:</strong> Show your phone number alongside your ad and enable customers to call you with one touch.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Callout extensions:</strong> These can improve your text ads by promoting special offers and appear as text at the bottom of your ad.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Lead form extensions:</strong> These take users directly from Google to your lead capture form so you can better understand their interest.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Location extensions:</strong> These help people find your business’s location(s) by displaying your ads alongside your address, a map, or the user's distance from your closest business location.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Structured snippet extensions:</strong> These highlight specific aspects of your offer with text below your ad. They include a header and list of selling points, benefits, products or services.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Sitelink extensions:</strong> Are extra hyperlinked text displayed in ads that you can set at account, campaign or Ad Group level. To maximize performance, Google recommends you provide at least six sitelinks with descriptions for all high-volume Ad Groups and campaigns. Sometimes Google may supplement your sitelinks with descriptions that you provided about each page you link to.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Price extensions:</strong> These appear below you text ads and include 8 cards that allow you to see your different options and pricing, with links going to relevant individual products or product listing pages. This information will give searchers a better idea of the range of your offering.</p>
                                    <h5 class="mt-5">How to make ad extensions more likely to show?</h5>
                                    <p>The three factors that determine when your extensions will show are:</p>
                                    <ul class="blog-list-features list-style-decimal mb-5 p-0">
                                        <li><strong>Ad Rank:</strong> Only ads with a sufficient bid amount, Quality Score and landing page will have an Ad Rank that is high enough to enable ad extensions to appear.</li>
                                        <li><strong>As Position:</strong> If there is some competition and limited advertising space available on the page, only ads at the top of the page will display extensions.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Other extensions:</strong> If you have several extensions enabled, then Google will usually display the most useful combination of your extensions in order to provide the best CTR possible.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Keep in mind that when setting up Ad extensions they can be approved or disapproved just like ads and keywords. Disapproved extensions will not be displayed and will need to be edited and submitted for review again.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Improving Ad Relevance</h3>
                                    <p>We have already identified Ad Relevance as a key component of Quality Score. So it makes sense that you should do everything you can to improve this. This can be achieved through: undertaking keyword research to improve targeting and optimizing ad copy to include target key terms as we explain below.</p>
                                    <p>By working on your Ad Relevance you will not only increase your Google Quality Scores but also your CTR. The more relevant your ads are, the more engagement they are likely to receive which can easily convert into sales for your business.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">6. Complete careful keyword research</h4>
                                    <p>Researching and selecting the best keywords that relate to your ads is vital to improving Ad Relevance. If you choose poor-performing keywords your ads will struggle to receive clicks and all your effort will be for nothing. Fortunately, you can edit or start bidding on more keywords whenever you like, so it is never too late to do your research.</p>
                                    <p>The first step in your keyword research is to identify common search terms that relate to your business. This can be simply writing a list of the terms you believe to be relevant. You can also use data about your website on Google Analytics, here you can see what terms people are searching in Google when they find your website.</p>
                                    <p>Secondly, use Google Keyword Planner to look up those keywords and find which variations are most searched and an idea of how competitive/costly it will be to bid on them. This will help you decide which key terms will be the best for you to bid on.</p>
                                    <p>By improving your keyword targeting in this way, you can improve Ad Relevance and Quality Score. Plus, when you align your target keywords and ad copy with what people are actually searching in Google your campaigns will become even more successful.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">7. Increase targeting in Ad Groups</h4>
                                    <p>You can easily break down your Ad Groups as small as you like, to the point where you have ads targeting a single key term. Increasing this targeting is not only likely to increase engagement in your ads; but also allow you to increase Ad Relevance. This will of course have a knock on effect of improving your Quality Score.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">8. Try Dynamic Keyword Insertion Ads</h4>
                                    <p>One way to improve your Ad-Level Quality Score on the Search Network is through Dynamic Keyword Insertion (DKI). When used carefully this approach can effectively increase ad CTRs as well as your Account-Level Quality Score. However, if you are not careful, you can easily make the wording on your ads awkward, incorrect and disengaging, damaging not only your campaign but also potentially the reputation of your business.</p>
                                    <p>There are a few different options for dynamic elements in your DKI ads to increase relevance and engagement.</p>
                                    <ul class="blog-list-features mb-5 p-0">
                                        <li>Automatically displaying users’ exact search terms in your ads</li>
                                        <li>Pulling the location of the user (city, state or country) and including this in the ad copy to increase relevance.</li>
                                        <li>Including an element that counts down in your ad. For example, a special offer that has an end date.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">9. Use Responsive Search Ads</h4>
                                    <p>Responsive Search Ads are a new ad format that allows Google to award a higher optimization score.</p>
                                    <p>Usually, you can write 3 headlines and 2 descriptions for each ad. However, sometimes this is not enough. Fortunately, Responsive search ads mean you can create additional headlines and descriptions that Google then selects from to create and display an advert with the most relevant and effective combination. Leveraging machine learning to measure and track the results, Google can steadily improve your ad’s performance.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Improving Landing Page Experience</h3>
                                    <p>As Landing page experience is one of the three key components of Quality Score, improving your landing pages can make all the difference. Keep a look out for Landing page experience scores of Average or lower and start trying to improve them in the following ways.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">10. Reduce page load times</h4>
                                    <p>The Quality Score’s Landing page experience component considers how useful and user friendly the webpage the ad links to is. One important aspect of having a user-friendly website is to keep your page load times low. Afterall, a <a href="https://websitesetup.org/news/website-load-time-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study by Akamai</a> found that a 2-second delay in page load speed can increase bounce rates by 103%, which just goes to show how much it plays a role in user experience.</p>
                                    <p>There are a few different ways to improve your page load times, but for the most part you will need to consult your web developer. Here are a few common things you can try as described  by <a href="https://www.woorank.com/en/edu/seo-guides/page-load-time" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" >WooRank:</a></p>
                                    <ul class="blog-list-features-compact mb-5 p-0">
                                        <li>Cleaning up and compressing code on your website.</li>
                                        <li>Compressing images or replacing them with images with smaller file sizes.</li>
                                        <li>Remove any unnecessary plugins.</li>
                                        <li>Remove any unnecessary tracking scripts.</li>
                                        <li>Update your CMS.</li>
                                        <li>Optimize caching on your website.</li>
                                        <li>Set Javascript files to load last or all at the same time.</li>
                                        <li>Avoid links to URLs that are set to redirect.</li>
                                        <li>Compress large files on your website.</li>
                                        <li>Combine files and images to decrease HTTP requests.</li>
                                        <li>Reduce your cookie size.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">11. Improve website accessibility</h4>
                                    <p>Anyone with a bit of experience in SEO will tell you how important it is to make your site as accessible as possible. These days the most important thing needed to make a site accessible is to make it mobile-friendly.</p>
                                    <p>Ultimately, Google wants to display ads to websites that its users will benefit from. So, if your site is not mobile-friendly you can bet that Google will avoid displaying your website for even the most relevant searches on mobile devices. Not sure if how mobile friendly your landing pages are? You can find out with Google’s <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mobile-Friendly Test</a>.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">12. Make new targeted landing pages</h4>
                                    <p>Make targeted landing pages for each individual Ad Group that include the keywords from searches and the ad copy.</p>
                                    <p>The pages should also discuss relevant, helpful information that answers the searchers’ queries and follow through with the ads call-to-action. For example, if someone is searching the name of a particular type of product like ‘running shoes’, you need to ensure that the landing page focuses on running shoes rather than any other type of shoe or sports equipment</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">13. Work on user experience</h4>
                                    <p>Ensuring a great user experience can come down to several elements. You can start by ensuring your page load times are kept low, as we mentioned previously. In addition it is important that the designs of your landing pages are functional, the layout is user-friendly, and that they contain no broken links.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">14. Testing your landing pages</h4>
                                    <p>The most useful metric for understanding the success of your landing pages is conversion rate. Although this does not contribute to your Landing page experience score, it does show you where your landing pages are failing to convert an adequate percentage of ad clicks to your goals.</p>
                                    <p>As we explain in the next section, Google provides plenty of options for testing your landing pages. Experiments in Google Ads provide data on conversion rates, Ad Relevance and Quality Score. Google Optimize offers more advanced testing and links with Google Analytics.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">Testing, tracking and optimizing</h3>
                                    <p>Nothing is perfect immediately and testing and optimizing is vital for steadily improving Expected CTR, Ad Relevance and Landing Page Experience.</p>
                                    <p>If you have enough data available, in Google Ads you can A/B test variations to your ads, ad groups or campaigns against the originals to improve performance.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">15. Experiments on Google Ads</h4>
                                    <p>In Google Ads you can use the Experiments tool to run custom experiments for Search, Display, and Video campaigns (currently experiments for App and Shopping campaigns are unavailable.</p>
                                    <p>Through Experiments you can easily test campaigns, ad groups and individual ads against each other. Here are some examples of the different elements you can test through Experiments in Google Ads:</p>
                                    <ul class="blog-list-features mb-5 p-0">
                                        <li><strong>Bidding Strategies:</strong> Although this will not affect your Google Quality Score, it is one of the most important factors to test and improve in Google Ads.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Landing Pages:</strong> Improve your conversion rates, Ad Relevance and Quality Score by testing and improving your landing pages.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Ads & Extensions:</strong> Including all creatives, copy, snippets and manual extensions.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Target Groups:</strong> Experiment with your targeting to find which ads work best for which audiences.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Google limits you to setting up a maximum of five experiments per campaign and you can only test one at a time. Before you start your campaign, you will be asked what percentage of the original campaign’s budget you want to use for your experiment.</p>
                                    <p>You also be given a choice of  how to split up your audience:</p>
                                    <p><strong>Cookie-Based:</strong> Users are assigned to either the experiment version or the original. This option provides the most reliable results as it ensures users only see the original or the experiment, not both.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Search-Based:</strong> Users are assigned to either the experiment version or the original campaign every time a search occurs. Therefore, the same user could see both the experiment and your original campaign. This is the quicker option, as you will receive more search data to base your decision on.</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">16. Google Optimize</h4>
                                    <p><a href="https://optimize.google.com/optimize/home/#/accounts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google Optimize</a> is another testing tool from Google that is separate from Google Ads. It can be used to test custom messaging and various elements on your website including any landing pages you are using in your Google Ads campaigns.</p>
                                    <p>It links with Google Analytics rather than Google Ads and is focused on your website’s data and finding areas on your site that can be improved. Through sophisticated targeting tools, Google Optimize allows you to create custom experiences for specific audiences and timings. Its advanced statistical modeling uses real-world performance in your experiments to provide accurate testing. </p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-5">17. Monitor your Quality Score overtime</h4>
                                    <p>Keeping a careful eye on how your Quality Changes over time. In this way, you can identify issues, learn which changes you are implementing are having the most effect. Not only is it encouraging to see how your work is having a positive impact, it is also some good news to bring to your leadership team.</p>
                                    <p>Unfortunately, many users describe the reporting in Google Ads as hard to get used to and missing some functions which can lead to many long hours building reports on Excel. This is yet another way external tools can help. The PPC Rocket platform, for example, records daily Quality Scores and offers easy-to-read graphs and visualizations to make tracking your Quality Scores over time and sharing your results efficient and effective.</p>

                                <div id="chapter-twelve">
                                    <h2>How quickly can you improve Quality Score?</h2>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">How long does it take for Quality Score to work after starting a new campaign?</h3>
                                    <p>If you make any of the adjustments above to try and improve your Quality Score you should not expect them to have an immediate impact. Changes can take time to take effect and it takes around 1,000 impressions for the changes to an individual ad to be recognized. Before that threshold Quality Scores can be volatile and inaccurate.</p>
                                    <h3 class="mt-5">When and how frequently are Quality Scores calculated?</h3>
                                    <p>Google calculates Quality Score every time an ad auction is run i.e. whenever a key term you are bidding on is searched by a user, the Quality Score is determined by the data available at that moment in time. The keyword-level Quality Score that is visible in Google Ads is an estimate.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div id="chapter-thirteen">
                                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                    <p>As you can see there are alot of factors that contribute to Quality Score and the score itself can relate to many different elements of Google Ads, from a whole ad group to individual keywords.</p>
                                    <p>Google introduced this metric to show its advertisers what aspects of their Google Ads Account(s) are good, bad and need to be optimized. For users, the metric is used to ensure the pages Google serves to users are the most useful possible. It is a key metric that requires hard work to improve, but boosting Quality Score will improve your advertising effectiveness while reducing your costs.</p>
                                    <p>We have already mentioned Google is unlikely to give you all the support and information needed to make your Quality Score as good as it can get. However, third party agencies and tools can fill in a lot of the blanks and many are far easier to use than Google Ads. For those looking to boost Quality Score and get their Google Ads working effectively for them, the PPC Rocket platform is the perfect place to start.</p>
                                    <p>When working on your Quality Score, it is important to remember that if you develop a strong Quality Score now, it can benefit every PPC campaign you are currently running on Google Ads and any you might launch in the future through the same account. So, investing the time and resources to improve your Google Quality Score now will be worth it in the long run.</p>
                                    <p>We have explained the many different approaches you can take to improve Quality Score, but with so many options it can be hard to know exactly where to begin. Without a lot of time, effort, errors and testing it can be difficult to increase this tricky metric, especially if you do not have extensive experience with Google Ads. With so many complicated factors to consider, it can take a long time to improve Quality Score, which is why even Google Ads specialists often still need to use external tools to shed light on how they can improve this elusive score.</p>
                                    <p>So, if you have read and understood this guide, but are still struggling with your Quality Score, it may be time to consider investing in an external tool or expert advice. If that sounds like you, we hope to hear from you very soon.</p>
