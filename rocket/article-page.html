                                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                                <p>It is easier and more cost-effective than ever to set up an online business and, in 2021, <a href="#">nearly 20%
                                    of global retail sales occurred online</a>. This means online competition is often fierce and it can be hard to win visits from the right users which you can then convert into sales. Luckily, Google is here to help. The Google Ads platform for advertising your website across Google Search and other sites can be highly effective if you know how to use it. Those with the relevant training and experience to set up and manage strong Google Ads campaigns can be a huge asset
                                    for all types ofbusinesses, which is where Google Ads Specialists can help. </p>

                                <p>Perhaps you are running an e-commerce shop, and need a Google Ad Specialist to help manage your online advertising. Or, maybe you are a marketer looking to expand your skills and learn
                                    more about Google Ads? Regardless of why you are interested, this article will provide a detailed
                                    explanation of the role of a Google Ads Specialist. Covering everything from what the job entails and how much it costs to become a Google Ads Specialist, to the formulas that allow the platform to function and external tools that make the job easier.</p>

                                <h3>What Does A Google Ads Specialist Do?</h3>

                                <div class="bg-dots top mb-4"><img src="img/main-img/blog-single/img-1.png" alt=""></div>

                                <p>In December 2021, Google was reported to be receiving <a href="#">86.19% of online global searches</a>. The closest rival was Bing, which received only a little over 7% of searches, making Google the prolific market leader of search engines.</p>

                                <p>It has been revealed that <a href="#">75% of people never scroll past the first page</a> of search engines.
                                    From this, it is clear why having your website listed at the top or relevant Google search
                                    results is so important. The quickest and easiest way to get your website featured at
                                    the top of relevant searches is through paid advertising on Google.</p>

                                <h3 class="mt-5">Google Ads</h3>
                                <p>Previously known as Google Adwords, Google Ads is the Google-made advertising platform that allows you to set up and control your PPC advertising campaigns. PPC stands for Paid Per Click, the method of online advertising where businesses pay a small fee each time their ad is clicked on. The idea is that the more clicks an advertisement receives, the more likely it is that one of the marketer’s lead or purchase goals will be met. </p>

                                <div class="blog-img"><img src="img/main-img/blog-single/img-2.png" alt=""></div>

                                <p>Google Ads Specialists use the platform to create ads targeting keywords related to the business they are promoting on Google. Then they make bids on the keyword, competing with other businesses also targeting the keyword for whose ad will appear. </p>
                                <p>Google Ads offers a variety of different campaign types for advertising on its various channels. These include Search, YouTube, Gmail, Shopping, Apps, and even display ads on third-party websites.</p>

                                <h3>Campaign Structure and Management</h3>
                                <p>Several campaigns can be launched through the same account and multiple keywords can be targeted by the same ads. Ads can also be managed in groups. Each Ad Group can include numerous related ads, for example creating one Ad Group targeting football shoes in one group and a separate one for running shoes adverts. Take a look at this diagram for an example of how a simple Google Ads account could be laid out. </p>
                                <div class="blog-img"><img src="img/main-img/blog-single/img-3.png" alt=""></div>

                                <h3>Ad Auction</h3>
                                <p>Whenever a user searches for a keyword you are targeting an automatic auction will take place. Google compares your Ad Rank with that of every other marketer targeting that keyword to decide whose ad should appear. The Ad Rank is determined by your bid amount and your ad’s Quality Score, a term which we will unpack later, that is designed to mean that Google will favor whichever website is likely to help the user most. The quality score will also affect the cost of each click an ad receives. Therefore, Google gives marketers with smaller budgets a chance to compete with those who have the funds to bid higher.</p>

                                <h3>Keyword Bidding</h3>
                                <p>When bidding you can set the maximum amount you are willing to pay for a click on your ad. In most cases in the USA, the cost of a click is usually around $1-2 but there are many different factors that influence the price so the actual range is far wider. If you are able to win the click for less than the max bid you set, Google will automatically bid the lowest possible winning bid for you. You can also set a max daily budget for bids on Campaigns to help you stay within budget. </p>

                                <h4>Google Ads Specialists can choose how they want to bid from several strategies including:</h4>

                                <ul class="top-list-features mb-5 p-0">
                                    <li>Cost-Per-Click (CPC): Cost is determined by users clicking on your ad.</li>
                                    <li>Cost-Per-Thousand Viewable Impressions (CPM): Cost is determined by how many
                                        thousands of times your ad appears (impressions). This can be based on an average
                                        you are willing to pay per thousand impressions (tCPM) or manually setting the highest

                                <p>An important part of a Google Ads Specialists role is the ongoing process of optimizing ads. This can be achieved through tracking their performance and making small changes to your
                                    ads, keywords, and targeting to steadily improve the ROI. </p>

                                <h3>Ad Testing</h3>
                                <p>Google Ads allows Google Ads Specialists to test similar ads against each other through
                                    a process often known as A/B testing. For every Ad Group you create you can test
                                    multiple styles of advert. In a text-based ad, you can test your title, headline, first
                                    line, second line, and display URL. </p>

                                <h3>Negative Keywords</h3>
                                <p>These are the searched keywords you do not want your ads to appear under. These are keywords that do not relate closely enough to your campaign or those that you have seen do not provide a good ROI. By adding negative keywords to your campaign, you can stop your ads appearing under them, avoiding wasting money on paying for clicks that are not helping you meet your business’s traffic and conversion goals. </p>

                                <h3>Targeting</h3>
                                <p>Google Ads gives you the option to target a specific geographical location in your campaign. For example, if you are a local business you could target a specific city, region, zip code, or near a certain location. </p>

                                <h3>What Is Google Quality Score?</h3>
                                <p>As previously mentioned Google Quality Score, alongside your bid amount, determines
                                    your Ad Rank. That is, the position your ad will appear on the search results page. The
                                    score is a number between one and ten and the higher your score, the better you’ll rank
                                    and the less money you will have to spend per click. </p>
                                <p>Google describes the Quality Score as: “An estimate of the quality of your ads, keywords,
                                    and landing pages. Higher quality ads can lead to lower prices and better ad positions.”</p>

                                <h2 class="mt-5">Does Google Ads Pay You?</h2>
                                <p>Google Ads does not pay you other than via the traffic it can bring to your website. However, Google does have an option to pay you to show third-party ads on your website. A Google AdSpecialist will usually be paid by the business that is employing them to run their Google Ads account. </p>
                                <p>In Google Ads, there are two different advertising networks to choose from. The Search Network includes Google’s SERPs and its other sites like Google Maps and Shopping, as well as other search sites that partner with Google to show ads. The Display Network is for image-based ads and covers websites like YouTube, Blogger, Gmail, and thousands of other third-party websites on Google's Display Network.</p>

                                <div class="float-img"><img src="img/main-img/blog-single/img-8.png" alt=""></div>

                                <p>You can get paid for choosing to host adverts through Google Adsense. To join the Display Network you need to access Google AdSense.
                                    This is a separate platform from Google Ads that allows you to set up, track display ads appearing on your site. Google AdSense usually falls under the role of a website manager or publisher, rather than that of a Google Ads Specialist. On average
                                    businesses on Google AdSense can make $3 per click, however this can vary a lot. Depending on your website's niche the price per click can be anywhere from $0.20 to $15.</p>

                                    recruitment agencies to help you find or fill a job, however, this can mean you are required
                                    to pay for their services. Another option is to contact related organizations like PPC Rocket,
                                    who have established a large network of clients interested in hiring Google Ads Specialists
                                    and qualified job seekers.

                                    consider and understand when managing a Google Ads account. Although most businesses

                                    of setting up and optimizing Google Ad campaigns can be daunting.</p>

                                <h4 class="mt-5">For an immediate impact and the chance</h4>
                                <p>Intro explaining who the article is for, what you will find out and why Google Ads Specialists
                                    are important for businesses. 
                                    </p>
                                <p>Thanks for this question. I think there are three main use cases.</p>
                                <p>1. A Company e.g. E-Commerce Shop is looking for a Google Ads Specialist to improve their performance. This scenario is great for PPC Rocket, you can hire a Google Ads Specialist or
                                    you get input e.g. Audits, etc. from PPC Rocket</p>
                                <p>2. Someone e..g a Freelancer is interested in becoming a Google Ads Specialist. Most likely they are not very deep into Google Ads. Also a good use-case, because with PPC Rocket they get
                                    support from the Tool when helping their customers to improve Google Ads Accounts.
                                    </p>
                                <p>3. Someone is looking for a Google Ads Specialist job, so they want to move to a new job/role. Also a good opportunity. When they start in the new job they will easily identify room for improvements
                                    with Google Ads.
                                    </p>
